# NodeJS Webservice Demo
A lightweight RESTful web service template, written in TypeScript, based on NodeJS - Express that exposes a Data Mart with OData.  The Prisma ORM is used for database abstraction and management.

<br/>

## Quick Start
### Installation
Installing packages and building the ORM client:
```
npm install
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```
### Server
Start a **development** instance with a .ts file watcher:
```
npm run dev
```
### Client
Query a webservice resource:
```
curl http://localhost:3000/api/example?$top=10
```

## Build and Management Systems
### Prisma
The [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs) ORM framework is beyond the scope of this documentation.  Its CLI takes the schema, located in the /prisma folder, and generates both client code and the actual database itself.

To initialize the database and generate the ORM code used by this project, first run:
```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```
After making subsequent schema changes you will need to regenerate the client using the following command:
```
npx prisma generate
```
To seed the database with sample data, run:
```
node prisma/seed.js
```
**Note:** This should be possible with Prisma: https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/database/seed-database

### NPM
NPM provides the following *run* commands for building and managing the project:
* `npm run build` - Production build written to [/dist/index.js](dist/index.js)
* `npm run start` - Runs the production build through Node
* `npm run dev` - Runs a development build through **ts-node-dev**
* `npm run test` - Run all unit tests
* `npm run test-coverage` - Run all unit tests with code coverage written to [/coverage](coverage/lcov-report/index.html)
* `npm run lint` - Perform static code analysis with eslint
* `npm run doc` - Generate API documentation in [/docs](docs/index.html)

### Docker
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com) is optionally used for creating images optimized for *production*.  Start a production container, after ensuring your database is created and seeded locally, by running:
```
docker-compose up node-webservice
```

### Zed Attack Proxy Scan
[OWASPÂ® Zed Attack Proxy](https://www.zaproxy.org) is the leading open-source web security vulnerability scanner.  [Docker](https://docs.docker.com) is a prerequisite, allowing us to reduce a large amount of complexity into a single command.

To scan `node-webservice`, ensure that your service is running in dev mode:
```
npm run dev
```

**NOTE**  The web service will not host the required `openapi.yml` publically in *production* mode for security reasons.

Then, in another console, run the ZAP scan:
```
docker-compose up zap-node
```

**NOTE**  If this is your first run, it may take a while to download the initial Docker images.

Your security report will be located at: `security/node-webservice-report.html`


### Visual Studio Code
This project was developed using VSC and contains the [launch.json](.vscode/launch.json) and [settings.json](.vscode/settings.json) files required to build and test the codebase.  Ensure you have the **Jasmine Test Explorer** installed.
